// /**
//  * Here we define our main query. Relay encourages you to split your data demands into
//  * multiple fragments in order to make components portable.
//  *
//  * As you can see below, each component we render that needs data from the server has
//  * its own fragment, which is spread on the query. This has a few benefits:
//  * - Each component is isolated, and no data leaks between components. No weird bugs when
//  *   things suddenly stop working because you thought you knew all places that field you
//  *   removed from your query was used.
//  * - Relay can optimize and make sure no component unecessarily re-renders, because it
//  *   knows exactly what data each component uses, and only updates a component if its
//  *   data has been updated.
//  *
//  * Fragments always have to end up in a query somehow, that's how they get their data.
//  * Relay wraps each fragments data in something called a fragment ref. A fragment ref
//  * is like a key that can be used to retrieve the data your fragment needs from the Relay
//  * store, and is what's left in the object where the data would've been. Each fragment
//  * then has a specific React hook that takes any object containing that particular
//  * fragments ref, and returns the fragment data.
//  *
//  * Whew, lots of information... But the only thing you really need to think about is that
//  * you _pass along fragment refs by passing the full object the fragment was spread on_.
